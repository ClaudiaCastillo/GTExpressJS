/*
Middleware functions are functions that
have access to the request object (req), the response object (res),
and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response
cycle. These functions are used to modify req and res objects for
tasks like parsing request bodies, adding response headers, etc.

   //function/route handler.
